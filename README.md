<h3 style="font-family: Helvetica, sans-serif;">About</h3>
<p style="font-family: Helvetica, sans-serif; margin-block: 0px">I’m a Gameplay Programmer and Software Engineer inspired by the immersive storytelling and rich experiences that video games can provide. My journey began at 14 when I watched The Making of The Last of Us after finishing the game. Seeing the passion and creativity of the developers ignited my own desire to create meaningful games; my personal way of repaying the devs for bringing purpose to my career.</p>
<p style="font-family: Helvetica, sans-serif; margin-block: 0px">Since then, I’ve honed my craft through both personal projects and professional experience, including internships at Snap Inc., where I contributed to production-ready features for the Snapchat mobile app and collaborated on cross-functional engineering projects. My work focuses on gameplay systems, mechanics, and user experience, always aiming to push the boundaries of what games can achieve.</p>
<p style="font-family: Helvetica, sans-serif; margin-block: 0px">I’m dedicated to mastering my methods, refining my storytelling and gameplay design, and delivering interactive experiences that leave a lasting impact.</p>
