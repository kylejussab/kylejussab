<h4 style="font-family: Helvetica, sans-serif;">I'm a Game Developer 🎮</h4>

#

<p style="font-family: Helvetica, sans-serif;">I am a student at the University of London, studying a BSc in Computer Science (Games Development). I cannot express my love for gaming and game development enough. At the age of 14 I watched a “behind the scenes” video on how a AAA video game was made and fell in love with the culture of game developers and the craft of making experiences in video games. I just want to be able to give an experience to at least one other person. My goal is to give someone the epiphany of wanting to be a game developer in the same way it was given to me which was by playing an amazing game. Since then, I haven’t looked back and I’m currently accelerating my learning in C# and Unity because I can’t physically wait another year to learn it in my degree.</p>
