<p style="font-family: Helvetica, sans-serif;">Iâ€™m studying a BSc in Computer Science (Games Development) with University of London. My goal is to learn as much as I can on how video games are built, and what makes those experiences truly engaging. To make a meaningful game I need to understand how and why games are developed. I donâ€™t just want to make them, I want to make them mean something.</p>

          <p style="font-family: Helvetica, sans-serif;">At the age of 14, after finishing the game, I watched The Making of The Last of Us. I instantly fell in love with the game development culture while being inspired by all the talented and creative people that bring a game to life. Without physically being there, I felt that this was the place for me, and this is the place I belong. In many ways I feel indebted to the game developers that gave me this sense of purpose and all I want to do is pay my debts by doing the same for others. I wouldnâ€™t be who I am without them.</p>
